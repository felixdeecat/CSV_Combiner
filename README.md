### About:

#### I struggled with cleaning the data, particularly in getting rid of the quotes. I re-approached the problem, removing quotes first before I manipulated data. 

#### I did not include error handling in my work. This is a step that needs to be done, as explained in the Test program. 

#### I did not test my program on large files, or on multiple files.

#### To be brutally honest, I didn't have time to perform the tasks above. Given more time or guidance, I could make a more solid program suite. 

#### Thank you for the challenge. I had fun, but I have much to learn and I fell well short of my goal for this project.
